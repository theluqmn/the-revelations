Jamie Dimon (James Dimon) is the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase - the fifth largest bank in the world (over $4.5 trillion in assets [[1]](https://companiesmarketcap.com/jp-morgan-chase/total-assets/) as of November 2025). It also operates the world's largest investment bank in the world by revenue [[2]](https://www.thebanker.com/content/8807acb2-4109-4d5a-aa3b-b2b4ba09922b). His name is formidable in the financial world. Dimon was born in 1956 in New York City of Greek ancestry, his father and grandfather were both stockbrokers at [Shearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearson).

## A paper to Sandy Weill to becoming his assistant

Jamie attended the Browning School [[3]](https://browning.edu/alumniawards) and later **studied psychology and economics** at Tufts University - where he wrote a paper on Shearson's mergers, which his mother sent to [Sandy Weill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanford_I._Weill). He became intrigued by the paper and hired Jamie to do budgets at Shearson during a summer break.

After graduating, he **worked as a [management consultant](https://www.coursera.org/articles/management-consulting)** at [Boston Consulting Group](https://www.bcg.com/) for two years (1978-1980) and later enrolled in [Harvard Business School](https://www.hbs.edu/). During the summers while he was at Harvard, he **worked at Goldman Sachs**. He **graduated top 5% of his class from HBS** in 1982 with a Master in Business Administration (MBA) and received countless offers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and other firms. **Sandy convinced him to turn down the offers and instead join him as an assistant** at American Express, acknowledging his potential. He promised Jamie that he would have fun despite lower compensations compared to the investment banks.

## An exceptional career in finance

**Dimon followed Sandy** as he left American Express in 1985. The two worked together and **took over Commercial Credit** - a consumer finance company, from Control Delta.
