Risk management is not a foreign topic in finance and business. The future carries with it various unknowns, classified as either uncertainties, risks, or opportunities. In this week's article, you will explore the difference between uncertainties and risks, how to spot risks and opportunities, as well as the risk management process - mitigation and exploitation of risks and opportunities respectively.

For this article, I personally interviewed [Dr David Hillson](https://risk-doctor.com), known globally known as the Risk Doctor, and is considered the pioneer of modern risk management. He has over 35 years of experience as a risk management consultant and have written at least 16 books on the topic. I would like to personally thank him for his assistance.

## A risk or uncertainty?

Risks is defined as uncertainties that matter - it affects the accomplishment of our objectives or goals. An example of risk, in the perspective of a project manager, is having a project overdue. This is uncertain, but it is not aligned to the objective of completing the project in time, which results in even more risk of losses.

Uncertainties is simply things we are not too certain of, but has little to no impact towards our objectives or goals. Being uncertain with what coffee to drink in the morning, is an example of uncertainty.

Context matters most when deciding an uncertainty as negligible or a risk. For a trader, high-latency internet is a risk which may result in losses, as the trader may lack the time to make trades according to market data. Meanwhile for the average consumer, high-latency internet means their YouTube video takes a second or two longer to load - a minor inconvenience.

## Not all uncertainties are bad

There are uncertain things in the future, that matters to your objectives in a positive way - [opportunities](https://youtu.be/mEuXOtY8k9s?si=wmbZ4kj7_XYczFPJ). These opportunities, if located and exploited, will aid in achieveing your objectives. As an example, for a corporation, having low interest rates in the upcoming months makes investors more willing to invest, therefore it is an opportunity.

## The risk management process

The reason humans have not gone extinct (yet) is because we conduct risk management (the uncertainty of being attacked by a predator and low visibility made us avoid going out at night). The risk management profession and techniques however, were only formalised around the 1980s. These techniques can be simplified into [the risk management process](https://youtu.be/BLAEuVSAlVM?si=jpZWBtH_VRCZIfFA) - consisting of six steps, that are intuitive, natural steps that you would be doing anyways.

### 1- Set objectives

Set clear, concise objectives as it allows the measurement of the progress you will be making. Moreover, it serves as a benchmark for measuring the success of your actions.

### 2- What affects the objectives?

Bring yourself to the future, and imagine the risks and opportunities that may present itself. This process, called forecasting, is often aided by computer simulations and/or data analysis. These tools uses historical data and current trends to predict the future with decent accuracy, through processes such as machine learning, markov chains, etc.

### 3- Filter by importance

Once risks have been identified, filter it according to its importance and potential impact. Context matters, as importance is subjective, therefore your existing worldview, values, and contexts must be assessed to determine which risks should be prioritised.

### 4- Execute a strategy

Think about the processes, changes, actions and decisions that you can take to mitigate the potential risks, and maximise the opportunities that you have identified to create a strategy. Remember, [a plan is not a strategy](https://youtu.be/iuYlGRnC7J8?si=tLslJo6oHJ6lNLvY). These strategies should be straightforward and a no-brainer.

Execute the strategy and monitor your progress.

### 5- Did it work?

Reflect on the outcome of your strategy. The world is constantly changing, so should your strategy. Monitor your progress, make adjustments if necessary, and repeat the process until your objectives are met.

### 6- Reflect on what changed

Locate to what degree did your strategy work - how much risk was mitigated, what opportunities were exploited. Assess the effectiveness and efficiency of your strategy as well as risk identification methods. Use this assessment as reference when making your strategy.

## Implementation

As mentioned earlier, the risk management process is intuitive and natural. Risk management is a built-in function in your brain. The risk management process must be implemented as a life skill - its application is limitless and can bring better decision-making into your life regardless of its context (personal, professional, at individual or even organisational levels). The application of these processes also allows you to have a firm control over your own future.

Let's explore an example:

- 1- Your objective is to score exceptionally on all subjects in your year-end examination.
- 2- Amongst the uncertainties that may present is burnout, limited time, and less entertainment.
- 3- The first two uncertainties is critical and therefore identified as risks. You also found out that a fellow classmate is also studying for the examination as early as you are, therefore you took it as a potential opportunity for a study partner.
- 4- You formed a strategy to mitigate these risks, and exploit the opportunity. To avoid burnout, you allocate ample time to rest and perform other activities to loosen the stress that may build up. Meanwhile, you apply clever time management techniques to allow enough time for everything you need. To realise the opportunity of having a study partner, you got closer to the classmate and exchanged study tips as well as explanations on several topics.
- 5- As the strategy is executed, you noticed better understanding of the subjects you learn, whilst maintaining good health and social life. This indicates that your strategy is working.
- 6- Time passed and you got your result - exceptional scores on all subjects, therefore the risks you identified were mitigated, and you exploited the opportunity that presented itself.

In a nutshell, apply risk management to make better decisions. It is a great tool for control over your own future.

Now, will you implement the risk management process?
