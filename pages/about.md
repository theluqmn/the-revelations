Growing up, I was given the opportunity to develop interests and gather various knowledge, thanks to my parents who emphassised on the importance of exposure. My father brought me to meet various entrepreneurs and bankers all over the world, whilst my mother taught me how to live independently and assist with house chores. Both of them studied computer science together in university. Free time became abundant when I was 11 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which revolutionised my life forever. I developed an interest in entrepreneurship, startups and finance, and got more involved with coding.

## The Information Crisis

If information and knowledge are abundant and accessible, then why is it arduous to benefit from it? My personal experience says it became overwhelming. The internet is filled with ideas, concepts, theories, and AI-generated slop. Furthermore, even if you discovered high-quality content on the internet, it would either be locked behind a paywall or cluttered with irrelevants ads and content (they had to profit somehow).

Another issue faced by the modern thinkers is the absence of a clear starting point. In my view, there is a significantly higher ratio of content for the experienced compared to the inexperienced. More the ones who know, little to none for those who wants to have a start.

## The Vision

## Leading The Way to Change

---

I started this newsletter on late January 2025 - the website design changed three times hahahaa, and hosted it on Github Pages (“theluqmn.github.io/revelations”). The agenda behind the creation of this newsletter is to share the knowledge, insights, and strategies that I have learnt throughout my life for othes to take benefit from - for free, out of good will. This project is also open source.

The Revelations is mainly targeted towards aspiring leaders, entrepreneurs, and curious individuals, but everyone is welcomed to have a look.
Vision
Exposure

The core vision of this newsletter is to expose the readers to countless topics that in my opinion, will aid in their quest to elevate their personal and professional lives. This includes an exceptional comprehension of STEM, finance, strategies, and more. With a larger exposure, readers will develop a better understanding of the world, and be able to make better decisions.
Safe Haven

The Revelations is designed as a safe haven from the clutter of the internet. Free from ads, AI-generated content (unless mentioned otherwise, I do use AI to aid with autocomplete but only the ones I approve are added), cookies, and is 100% open source. It just works.
Catalyst

Mosts people among us is struggling to grasp certain topics not due to their lack of intelligence, but rather due to the absence of a clear starting point. The articles on this newsletter are designed to solve this issue - using comprehensive and concise content as an overview, and a Dive Deeper section at the end, which includes countless resources that aims to guide you through a deeper understanding of the topic, in case readers are interested.
Design

As previously mentioned, the design of this newsletter changed three times before I was satiesfied. In the world of fast-paced business, this would not happen but thank god it is a personal project - so I dictate the rules. I am actually a technical person (an Airbus A350 cockpit or a Bloomberg Terminal excites me), however, I went with a minimalist “it just works yet looks good” design by simply referring to a random invoice I found on Google (yes the design is based on an invoice), and slapped a dark seamless concrete background texture on it. I received positive feedback from several people, though some cricized it for being lacking technicality.
